    <h2>Gba Modding!</h2>
    <h3>Why would you want to?</h3>
    <p>
      The Gameboy Advance is a legendary handheld console from 2001. With over
      80 million units sold worldwide with a substantial library of about 1500
      released games, and with backwards compatibility the system can run well
      over 3000 games. Nostalgia factor included there should be no reason to
      not have a playable GBA in your near vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>But being over 20 years old the handheld system is showing its age.</p>

      The shell is the case or the plastic that surrounds all the internal
      components of the game system. A lot of the GBA models had quite colorful
      shells. But as the years went by, the shell became dull, dirty and faded.
      And maybe the original color was not colorful enough, or you wanted
      something more personal. With a new custom shell you can have any color or
      prints/images you want. The shell can even be fully transparent! This will
      make your GBA look new again. Also worth mentioning: If you want to
      install any mod, you should consider buying a custom shell. This is
      because some of the mods require you to cut into the shell itself to have
      enough space. A lot of the custom shells are pre-cut especially for these
      mods, so you don’t have to do anything.

      Who uses AA batteries these days? Fewer and fewer electrical appliances
      use single use batteries anymore. With a battery mod you can have a
      rechargeable battery that uses USB-C! (Remember to buy a backplate for the
      battery slot with a hole for USB-C cable.)
    </p>

      The original screen is not backlit and lacks sufficient brightness..
      Making it useless if your surroundings aren’t bright enough, and it might
      still be useless if it’s too bright. A newer model of the GBA was
      released, that might be enough for some people. But for many even that
      screen lacks what we require of modern displays.

      Some people complain that the GBA speaker is too weak. I personally do not
      feel this way, but there are still very good reasons to consider
      installing an audio mod or two. The two main ones are the Audio Amplifier
      and the Dehum-Dehis-kit. The former can potentially boost the speaker
      volume to 500% of the original, and the latter removes almost all of the
      humming sound or white noise from the console (this also fixes headphone
      humming.) It is probably advisable to also replace the old speaker with a
      new one if you intend to install any audio mod.

      Newer controllers and handheld consoles have these satisfying clicky
      buttons. The GBA SP has excellent L and R button feedback when pressed.
      The original GBA… does not. With the clicky triggers the L and R button
      for the original GBA will feel almost like the GBA SP L and R buttons.
      Definitely worth it!
    </p>

      Do you want to have LED on your GBA? You can! LED flashing when you press
      the transparent shoulder buttons. Is it necessary? No. Is it awesome? Yes.
